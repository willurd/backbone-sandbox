# Backbone Sandbox

A sandbox for playing with backbone application architecture and development.

## What is this?

This is a random app I'm building so I can try out different application-level and micro architectures to use when building backbone applications.

I choose to build an "intranet" application because it gives me the opportunity to build a wide variety of features all within the same application, including (possibly) sub-applications.
